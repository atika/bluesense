# BlueSense AppleScripts
AppleScripts you can use with BlueSense for Mac OS X available on the Mac Apple Store [http://apple.co/1deLPT5](http://apple.co/1deLPT5) or in your own program of course.

BlueSense intelligently monitors the signal from your **Bluetooth device** and runs applescripts when you leave or return at proximity of your Mac.

You can lock your Mac, launch screensaver, disable OSX automatic session, pause music or anything else when you leave your desktop, or **automatically unlock your Mac** when you return. You do what you want, you are not limited by the application.
