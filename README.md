[BlueSense](https://apps.inspira.io/bluesense/en/) analyzes the signal of your **Bluetooth device** and **executes any desired actions** when you move away or come back at proximity of your Mac.
Decide what [BlueSense](https://apps.inspira.io/bluesense/en/) has to do when your device is detected or far off your Mac, and even when you are away for a long time.
**BlueSense triggers [custom scripts](https://apps.inspira.io/bluesense/en/bluesense-applescripts-osx-exemples.html)** when your Bluetooth device is detected, far-away or not detected for a long period.

You can do things like lock your Mac, launch the screensaver, disable Mac OS X automatic session, play and pause Deezer or Spotify, change the status of Skype, **automatically unlock your Mac** or anything else when you leave your desktop or return near your Mac. You do what you want because you are not limited by the application.
